What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Just overall Knowledge about some of the commands. Need to practice more.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Markdown commands and git command usage mainly the conflict resolution.


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What Happens if you clone a file into a git file.
Asked Pair different questions about the task we were preforming and if we felt we were doing them correctly.
Partner was unsure about why repo wasn't showing up for him. Figured out that it was because he was the collab on the project.


What still confuses you about Git?
I feel very comfortable with Git.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I was nervous at first and it's just going to take a lot of practice to get used to pairing and the dynamic about how it should go.
